# SensioTV+

**"SensioTV+"** is a reference application created for Symfony 5 training sessions to show how to develop applications following the Symfony Best Practices, according to SensioLabs University courses.

**Each branch is equal to a Symfony training session.**

## Installation instructions

### Project requirements

- [PHP ^7.2.5 or higher](http://php.net/manual/fr/install.php)
- PDO-SQLite PHP extension enabled;
- [Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
- and the [usual Symfony application requirements][1].

### Installation

1 . Clone the current repository:
```bash
$ git clone 'https://github.com/sensiolabs/training-sensio-tv'
```

2 . Move in and create one global `.env.local` or few `.env.{environment}.local` files according to your environments with your default configuration.
**This one is not committed to the shared repository.**
> `.env` equals to the last `.env.dist` file before [november 2018][2].

3.a . Execute these commands below into your working folder to install the project:
```bash
$ composer install
$ composer update
$ yarn install
$ yarn run dev
$ bin/console doctrine:database:create
$ bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
$ bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

3.b . Or just call the Makefile's install rule :
```bash
$ make install
```

> The project's Makefile has few rules which could be very useful. 
> In fact, you have some rules for Q&A tools and unit/functional tests.
> Take a look on it !

## Usage

```bash
$ cd sensiotv/
$ symfony serve --no-tls
```

If you don't have the Symfony binary installed, run `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`
to use the built-in PHP web server or [configure a web server][3] like Nginx or
Apache to run the application.

## Tests

Execute this command to run tests:

```bash
$ cd sensiotv/
$ ./bin/phpunit
```
